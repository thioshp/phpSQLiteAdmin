phpSQLiteAdmin
==============

#How to use
phpSQLiteAdmin makes use of a simple user system. The default information is listed below:
Default username: root
Default password: root

#Installing
Just copy the directory phpsqliteadmin2 to your webserver. You need the PHP SQLite extension. Since PHP 5.0 this extension was bundled with PHP. Beginning with PHP 5.4, this extension is available only via PECL:
```
apt-get install php-pear php-dev
pecl install sqlite
```
If this doesn't work, download and install manually with
```
cd /tmp/
wget https://pecl.php.net/get/SQLite-1.0.3.tgz
tar xvzf SQLite-1.0.3.tgz
cd SQLite-1.0.3/
phpize
```

Windows users can find the php_sqlite.dll in the PEAR repository. Under Linux/Unix, you can either install it by typing "pear install sqlite", or in case you are using Debian Linux: "apt-get install php5-sqlite".

###Important:
The system database `db/phpsla.sqlite` must be read/writeable by the user the webserver runs under. You probably have to modifiy the file's permissions. Note that under Linux/Unix the directory in which the database resides in must also be writeable! The same is true for any other database you want to manage with phpSQLiteAdmin.
